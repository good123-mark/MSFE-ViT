This repository provides the official implementation of the MSFE-ViT model for offshore aquaculture segmentation. MSFE-ViT is developed upon the MMSegmentation framework, with customized modules including the MSFE Decoder and Loss integrated into its model architecture. Only the components directly related to MSFE-ViT (such as the custom decode head and configurations) are included in this repository. Users can reproduce the full experimental workflow by installing MMSegmentation and placing the provided files into the corresponding directories.
